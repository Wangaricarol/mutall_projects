    - Change the database according to the specifications.
     - [ ] Remove the accounting table. ` It is part of the Accounting model`,
     - [ ] Change the `client` entity/table to `tenant`.

- The migration module helps in the visualization of the movement of applications and databases from `Mutall.co.ke` to `Digital Ocean`.
  During the migration, the system is set to change its operability style but retain its operability functions.
  The migration module will help do that, and it is visualized below.
