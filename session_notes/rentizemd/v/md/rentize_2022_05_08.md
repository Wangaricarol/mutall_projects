- Upgrade mutall_rental to rentize,i.e., have the accounting bit in mutall_rental separated to
  - rentize.
  - accounting module.
- `Other Objectives`.  
  - Change the database according to the specifications.
  - [ ] Remove the accounting table.`It is part of the Accounting model`,
  - [ ] Change the `client` entity/table to `tenant`.

- The migration module helps in the visualization of the movement of applications and databases from `Mutall.co.ke` to `Digital Ocean`.
  During the migration, the system is set to change its operability style but retain its operability functions.
  The migration module will help do that, and it is visualized below.
